this is a script to setup <a href=https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/PPPwn>PPPwn</a> on the raspberry pi and run <a href=https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN>GoldHen</a> on the PS4 fw 11.0<br>

Tested on the following models<br>
<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/>Raspberry Pi 3B+</a><br>
<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/>Raspberry Pi 4 Model B</a><br>
<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/>Raspberry Pi 5</a><br>
<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/>Raspberry Pi 400</a><br>

these work but are slow and not really recommended.<br>

<a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/>Raspberry Pi Zero W</a> with usb to ethernet adapter<br>


<br>

you need to install <a href=https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/>Raspberry Pi OS Lite</a> onto a sd card.<br>
place the sd card into your computer and copy the PPPwn folder to the sd card.<br>


<br>

if you are using a <b>usb to ethernet adapter</b> you need to edit <a href=https://github.com/stooged/PI-Pwn/blob/main/PPPwn/run.sh>run.sh</a> and set `USBETHERNET=true`.<br>
if your pi has an ethernet port and you are using a usb to ethernet adapter your interface for the usb adapter should be `INTERFACE="eth1"`<br>
if you are using something like a pi zero 2 the interface will be `INTERFACE="eth0"`<br>


<br>


place the sd card into the raspberry pi and run the following commands<br>


```sh
sudo chmod 777 /boot/firmware/PPPwn/install.sh
sudo bash /boot/firmware/PPPwn/install.sh
```

once the pi reboots pppwn will run automatically.<br>



On your PS4:<br>

- Go to `Settings` and then `Network`<br>
- Select `Set Up Internet connection` and choose `Use a LAN Cable`<br>
- Choose `Custom` setup and choose `PPPoE` for `IP Address Settings`<br>
- Enter `ppp` for `PPPoE User ID` and `PPPoE Password`<br>
- NOTE if you enable internet access you must match the username and password entered during the install or use the default `ppp`
- Choose `Automatic` for `DNS Settings` and `MTU Settings`<br>
- Choose `Do Not Use` for `Proxy Server`<br>


for GoldHen you need to place the goldhen.bin file onto the root of a usb drive and plug it into the console


once everything is setup and the ethernet cable is plugged in between the pi and the console the pi should automatically try and pwn the console.<br>
the exploit may fail many times but the pi will continue to purge the console to keep trying to pwn itself.<br>
once pwned the process will stop and the pi will shut down if you are not using internet access. <br>

you will need to restart the pi if you wish to pwn the console again.<br>

the idea is you boot the console and the pi together and the pi will keep trying to pwn the console without any input from you, just wait on the home screen until the pppwn succeeded.<br>


you can edit the exploit scripts by putting the sd card in your computer and going to the PPPwn folder.<br>
